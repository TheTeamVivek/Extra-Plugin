## Plugins Overview

This repository includes various plugins that extend the capabilities of the YukkiMusic bot. These plugins utilize the `app` client (Pyrogram), `logger` (initialized client of logging), and `utils` (utility functions) without needing to import them explicitly.

### Example Usage

You can use the attributes and functions provided by `utils.py` directly in your plugins. Here are some examples:

These are some attributes of [`utils`](https://github.com/TheTeamVivek/Extra-Plugin/blob/master/utils.py)
- `utils.get_image(cid)`
- `utils.save_couple(cid, date, couple, img)`
- `utils.set_welcome(chat_id, message, raw_text, file_id)`

You also can use the `app` That is Pyrogram Client without importing and same as with `logger` for logging purposes like logger.info("Hello World")

You can also leverage the dynamic attributes added in [`YukkiMusic/core/bot.py`](https://github.com/TheTeamVivek/YukkiMusic/blob/master/YukkiMusic/core/bot.py) to enhance your plugins.
